                    <h2>Stratovolcanoes</h2>
                    <p>These are majestic and often cone-shaped volcanoes built through alternating layers of lava flows, ash, and volcanic debris. Stratovolcanoes, such as Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Vesuvius in Italy, are known for their explosive eruptions and steep slopes. They can reach great heights and pose significant hazards due to the potential for pyroclastic flows and lahars.</p>

                    <h2>Shield Volcanoes</h2>
                    <p>Unlike stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes have broad, gently sloping profiles resembling a warrior's shield. They are formed by the accumulation of fluid lava flows, resulting in broad volcanic fields. Shield volcanoes, like Mauna Loa in Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands' volcanoes, are known for their effusive eruptions, producing runny lava that can flow for great distances.</p>

                    <h2>Cinder Cone Volcanoes</h2>
                    <p>Cinder cones are small, steep-sided volcanoes formed by explosive eruptions of gas-rich magma. These eruptions eject fragmented lava called cinders or scoria, which pile up around the vent to form a conical shape. Cinder cones are typically found on the flanks of larger volcanoes or as standalone features. Paricutin in Mexico is a famous example of a cinder cone that emerged from a cornfield in 1943.</p>

                    <h2>Fissure Volcanoes</h2>
                    <p>Fissure volcanoes, also known as fissure vents or fissure eruptions, occur when magma erupts along elongated cracks in the Earth's surface. Instead of a single vent, a long fissure opens up, allowing lava to flow out in curtain-like fashion. Fissure eruptions can produce vast lava fields and are characteristic of volcanic regions like the Icelandic Rift Zone.</p>
