      <h3>Volcanoes</h3>
      <p>
        Stratovolcanoes: These are majestic and often cone-shaped volcanoes built through alternating layers of lava flows, ash, and volcanic debris. Stratovolcanoes, such as Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Vesuvius in Italy, are known for their explosive eruptions and steep slopes. They can reach great heights and pose significant hazards due to the potential for pyroclastic flows and lahars.
        Shield Volcanoes: Unlike stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes have broad, gently sloping profiles resembling a warrior's shield. They are formed by the accumulation of fluid lava flows, resulting in broad volcanic fields. Shield volcanoes, like Mauna Loa in Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands' volcanoes, are known for their effusive eruptions, producing runny lava that can flow for great distances.
        Cinder Cones: Cinder cones are small, steep-sided volcanoes formed by explosive eruptions of gas-rich magma. These eruptions eject fragmented lava called cinders or scoria, which pile up around the vent to form a conical shape. Cinder cones are typically found on the flanks of larger volcanoes or as standalone features. Paricutin in Mexico is a famous example of a cinder cone that emerged from a cornfield in 1943.
        Calderas: Calderas are immense volcanic depressions formed by the collapse of a magma chamber after a massive eruption or series of eruptions. These eruptions can be so explosive that they empty the magma reservoir, causing the ground above to collapse. Calderas can be several kilometers in diameter and often host stunning crater lakes, such as Crater Lake in Oregon, USA, and Lake Taupo in New Zealand.
        Fissure Volcanoes: Fissure volcanoes, also known as fissure vents or fissure eruptions, occur when magma erupts along elongated cracks in the Earth's surface. Instead of a single vent, a long fissure opens up, allowing lava to flow out in curtain-like fashion. Fissure eruptions can produce vast lava fields and are characteristic of volcanic regions like the Icelandic Rift Zone.
        Submarine Volcanoes: As the name suggests, submarine volcanoes form beneath the ocean's surface. They are often part of volcanic island chains or located along tectonic plate boundaries. Submarine volcanoes can erupt explosively, forming new islands, or erupt quietly, producing pillow lava. They are crucial for the creation of new seafloor and can influence ocean chemistry and marine ecosystems.
